# Video Content Management System 

## Overview
This document outlines the design and implementation of a video content management system that supports video uploads, metadata extraction, authentication and authorization, and integration with SCORM Cloud. It also describes the backend and frontend functionalities, including video playback tracking and user interface (UI) enhancements. The system is designed to handle video uploads, metadata extraction, content rendering, and progress tracking, ensuring smooth playback and responsive design.

## Backend Setup
1. Authentication and Authorization
To ensure that video uploads and access are restricted to authorized users, we implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. A middleware layer is set up to validate user tokens and permissions, using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Role-based access control (RBAC) is introduced to handle different user permissions, such as video uploaders, viewers, and administrators.

2. Handling Video Content Metadata
Upon video upload, the backend extracts metadata from the video file, including duration, format, resolution, file size, and codec information. This metadata is stored in a MongoDB database alongside the video content's details, allowing for efficient retrieval and display in the frontend. Metadata is validated to ensure it meets the system's compatibility requirements before being uploaded to the SCORM Cloud.

3. Video Content Storage and SCORM Cloud Integration
Uploaded videos are stored locally or in a cloud storage service, depending on system configuration. Once uploaded, the system integrates with SCORM Cloud to store both the video file and its metadata. An API connection to SCORM Cloud ensures that the video is uploaded correctly and associated metadata is tracked, allowing for reporting and progress monitoring.

4. Error Handling and Logging
A robust error-handling system is implemented to manage issues such as file upload failures, unsupported video formats, and metadata extraction errors. All video operations are logged for troubleshooting and auditing purposes. Logs include information about video uploads, playback events, and user interactions. The error logs are centralized and can be monitored for system performance and issues.

5. Video Content Validation
Before video content is stored or uploaded, the backend validates the compatibility of the video format. It checks the video codec, resolution, and file size to ensure they are within supported parameters. Videos that do not meet these requirements trigger error responses, preventing upload and providing the user with feedback on why the video is not supported.

6. Testing the Backend
The backend is thoroughly tested using tools like ThunderClient and Postman to ensure all API endpoints are functioning as expected. Tests include uploading videos, fetching video metadata, validating authentication mechanisms, and integrating with SCORM Cloud.

## Frontend Setup
1. Video Player Integration
The frontend includes a video player component designed to fetch and display video content from the backend. The video player supports basic controls such as play, pause, forward, and rewind, providing a user-friendly interface for interaction. The player is built with React and integrates seamlessly with the backend to retrieve video metadata and content.

2. Responsive Design
The video player and its surrounding UI are designed to be responsive, ensuring compatibility with different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Tailwind CSS or a similar framework is used to implement responsive layouts and ensure that the UI adjusts seamlessly to various devices and resolutions.

3. Video Playback Tracking
To enhance user experience and provide completion tracking, the frontend records and stores the timestamp when a user pauses or stops a video. This data is sent to the backend and stored, allowing users to resume videos from where they left off. The backend can also report video completion status, which is sent to the database or SCORM Cloud to reflect user progress.

4. Progress Tracking and Display
The UI includes indicators to show the user's progress for each video. For example, once a user completes a video, a "completed" badge is displayed next to the video title. The progress is continuously updated in real-time to reflect the user's progress, even if they have watched the video partially.

5. Optimizing Video Loading Times
Efforts are made to optimize video loading times and reduce buffering. Techniques such as lazy loading, content delivery networks (CDNs), and efficient caching are employed to enhance performance. The video player is optimized to load and buffer content intelligently, improving the user experience, especially in low-bandwidth scenarios.

## Workflow Validation
The entire workflow is tested to ensure the system functions correctly:

Video Upload and Metadata Extraction: The user uploads a video, and the system extracts and stores the metadata correctly.
SCORM Cloud Integration: Videos are uploaded to SCORM Cloud along with their associated metadata.
Playback Functionality: The frontend retrieves video metadata and displays the video correctly with proper controls. User interactions such as play, pause, and resume work as expected.
Completion Status and Progress Tracking: User progress is accurately tracked and stored, with completion statuses reflected in the UI and stored in SCORM Cloud.
